Installs as an image or on top of Debian/Ubuntu.\n* [Docker](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/): For those already at comfortable with running on Docker. You install other software and manage backups yourself. Consider another option if you're using Windows or macOS.\n* [venv](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/raspberry-pi/): For those Linux admins or other crazy folks who want to run bare metal. You do everything, including rebuilding your venv with new Python versions. Don't try this method on Windows.\n\nTL/DR: Use what works for you."
